			Assignment 4
1)
a) I created a master pattern file from the given data using a parser I wrote in C++.
It converted all the commas to spaces and replaced the iris name field with three
boolean values.  A copy of the source listing is attached.

b) The training set contained 96 patterns.  This odd number was reached by subtracting out
the test and validation data sets.  The validation set contained 45 patterns.  I took 15
patterns from each iris type to arrive at this number.  The test set contained 9 patterns,
with three patterns from each type.

c) The test data was classified correctly every time.  There was no significant error in
any of the test classifications.  Either the network worked properly or I made a fundamental
flaw in my network design and implementation.

I tried many different networks, but had poorer results with a wider network.  The more
layers I added, the worse the error became.  I decided on a single hidden layer since I
had the most success with it.  I think my network turned out well, but I am not sure
it is an optimum design.

2)
a) See above (!).

b) See attached sheets.

c) See attached sheets.

d) See attached sheets.
